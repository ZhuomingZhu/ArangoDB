_key should be unique, I tried it. please do not consider the second part of nt as a key. Consider it as a attribute.



https://docs.arangodb.com/2.1/Edges/README.html

above link shows that edges collection is almost same as normal collection, but edges have _from and _to, it also contains _key, _id, _rev.

Thus, we may need to consider the second part of nt as _key.
